AssertionError in UNION ALL query #5751
 solved 





Your CTE is merging two datasets:

One is an on-the-fly aggregation using SAMPLE BY 10m over trades

The other is a historical pre-aggregated table trades_OHLC_15m

The likely issue:
In your first SELECT, you're using:

sql
Copy
Edit
first(price) AS open,
max(price) AS high,
min(price) AS low,
last(price) AS close,
sum(amount) AS volume
Which means these fields are aggregated and of scalar types (e.g. double, long).

In the second SELECT * FROM trades_OHLC_15m, you likely return:

A full row — with potentially different column order, additional columns, or slightly mismatched types.

Then UNION ALL tries to merge both, and QuestDB hits an internal assertion bug due to incompatible or ambiguous schema resolution.

✅ Recommended Fixes
1. Explicitly Select and Match Columns in trades_OHLC_15m
Don't use SELECT *. Instead, align both queries explicitly:

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH historical_and_recent_trades AS (
  SELECT
    timestamp, symbol,
    first(price) AS open,
    max(price) as high,
    min(price) as low,
    last(price) AS close,
    sum(amount) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE timestamp >= dateadd('d', -1, date_trunc('day',now()))
  SAMPLE BY 10m
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    timestamp, symbol,
    open, high, low, close, volume
  FROM trades_OHLC_15m
  WHERE timestamp > dateadd('m', -6, date_trunc('month',now()))
    AND timestamp < dateadd('d', -1, date_trunc('day',now()))
)
SELECT open, high
FROM historical_and_recent_trades
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
This ensures same schema, same order, no wildcard surprises.

⚠️ Known Bug in QuestDB 8.3.3
This looks like a known internal bug that occurs when QuestDB's planner can't infer matching types cleanly during a UNION with one side being aggregated or sampled. The checkIfSetCastIsRequired() method was responsible for verifying type alignment and failed due to an unhandled edge case.

✅ Solution: Upgrade to a newer QuestDB version (8.4 or later). Several UNION-related bugs were fixed.

📌 Summary
❌ Avoid SELECT * in UNION ALL

✅ Match column names and types explicitly

⬆️ Upgrade to QuestDB >= 8.4 (if possible)
